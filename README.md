### Regression
Second added notebook is **02_regression** which shows how to calculate regression coefficients for the iris dataset selected columns.

### Bootstrap
Third notebook presents the use of bootstrapping technique to calculate the impact on the mean value of sepal length and sepal width and calculation of the confidence intervals. The examples are shown in **03_bootstrap_replicates** notebook.
For regression with bootstrap technique visit **04_boostrap_regression** notebook.

### Hypothesis testing
Initial version of a notebook prepared but still requires fine tunning.
